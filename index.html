<h2>Hi!</h2>

<p>My name is Kate Hanson. I am a senior in the Technical Writing &amp; Communication program at the
  University of Minnesota. I plan to graduate in the spring with my Tech Comm BS and a minor in management.
  I hope to become some type of coordinator, whether that be an event coordinator, a program coordinator,
  or a project manager.</p>

<p> I like to run, hammock, watch hockey, skate, and play with my dog. I also like to knit and make
  friendship bracelets, and I hope to start to learn embroidery soon (I know I sound like a grandma! :))</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p><b>University of Minnesota</b>
  <br>Anticipated: May 2020

  <br>Minor, Management</p>

<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
<p>I did gymnastics as a child.
<br>My favorite color is blue.
<br>A car crashed into my house last week.
<br>I have never broken a bone.
<br>I fell on a Lime scooter once.
<br>I grew up in Apple Valley, MN.
<br>I think it would be really fun to be a personal trainer or yoga instructor.</p>
